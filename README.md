TrioTemp: Simplified Description
TrioTemp is a practical and affordable medical device designed for neonatal care in hospitals in Kampala, Uganda. It helps monitor and display the temperatures of three babies simultaneously, providing accurate readings to support better care in NICUs.

Key Features

Temperature Monitoring:
TrioTemp measures the temperatures of three babies using NTC thermistors with an accuracy of ±0.1°C.
Displays the current, lowest, and highest recorded temperatures for each baby on an LCD screen.
Alert System:
LED indicators show the baby’s condition:
Blue: Low temperature.
Green: Normal range.
Red: High temperature.
A buzzer alerts nurses when temperatures are outside the normal range, with a mute option for convenience.
Durable and User-Friendly:
Designed for low-resource settings with a simple interface and energy-efficient components.
Easily maintained and operated by medical staff.
Technical Details

Sensors: Uses thermistors and the Steinhart-Hart equation for accurate temperature calculations.
Software: Processes data with a moving average to reduce errors.
Hardware: Arduino-based, with LEDs and a buzzer for alerts.
Purpose

TrioTemp ensures reliable, real-time temperature monitoring to help detect risks like hypothermia or high fever in newborns. It’s a cost-effective solution for improving neonatal care in low-income hospitals.
